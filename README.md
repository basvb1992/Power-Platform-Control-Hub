# 🚀 Power Platform Control Hub

A **Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit dashboard replacement** built as a [Power Apps Code App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/code-apps/overview). It uses the [Power Platform Inventory API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/inventory-api) and several Power Platform admin connectors — including **Microsoft Dataverse** — to surface a real-time view of all resources across your tenant: canvas apps, model-driven apps, cloud flows, agent flows, code apps, Copilot Studio agents, and environments. No CoE Starter Kit solution required.

🔐 Authentication is handled entirely by the Power Apps host. No app registration or MSAL configuration is required.

```

**Data flow:**
1. The Power Apps host handles authentication — the app renders immediately with no login screen.
2. `useInventory` and `useAdminData` call the generated connector service clients on mount.
3. Connector calls are proxied through the Power Apps host to the respective admin APIs.
4. Results are stored in React state and rendered by the view components.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version |
|---|---|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS) | 18 |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) | any |
| Power Platform environment with **code apps enabled** | — |
| Power Platform **tenant admin** account | — |

---

## 🔌 Connector Setup

This app requires **five connectors**. For each one, create a connection in [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) (**Connections → New connection**), note the Connection ID from the URL, then run `add-data-source`.

| Connector | API ID | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Power Platform Admin V2 | `shared_powerplatformadminv2` | [Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/powerplatformadminv2/) |
| Power Platform for Admins | `shared_powerplatformforadmins` | [Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/powerplatformforadmins/) |
| Power Apps for Admins | `shared_powerappsforadmins` | [Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/powerappsforadmins/) |
| Flow Management | `shared_flowmanagement` | [Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/flowmanagement/) |
| Microsoft Dataverse | `shared_commondataserviceforapps` | [Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/) |

### Steps after cloning

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialise the Code App (creates power.config.json if missing)
npx power-apps init --display-name "Power Platform Control Hub"

# Add each connector (answer "No" when asked about connection references)
npx power-apps add-data-source -a shared_powerplatformadminv2    -c <connection-id>
npx power-apps add-data-source -a shared_powerplatformforadmins  -c <connection-id>
npx power-apps add-data-source -a shared_powerappsforadmins      -c <connection-id>
npx power-apps add-data-source -a shared_flowmanagement          -c <connection-id>
npx power-apps add-data-source -a shared_commondataserviceforapps -c <connection-id>
```

The `src/generated/` folder is **gitignored** — every collaborator must run `add-data-source` after cloning to regenerate the typed service clients.

---

## 💻 Local Development

```bash
npx power-apps run
```

This starts a Vite dev server and opens Power Apps in local mode. The app connects to your real tenant data with hot reload enabled.

---

## 🚢 Deploy to Power Apps

```bash
npx power-apps push --solution-id <your-solution-id>
```

The CLI prints a Power Apps URL when the push succeeds.

---

## 📦 Dataverse Solution

A companion Dataverse solution is included in the `solution/` folder. It provides the `ppa_resourcetombstone` table used for soft-delete / tombstone tracking of resources.

```powershell
# Import the solution into your environment
pac solution import --path solution\PowerPlatformControlHub_1_0_0_0.zip --environment <environment-id>
```

The solution source is unpacked in `solution/src/` and can be re-packed after changes:

```powershell
pac solution pack --zipfile solution\PowerPlatformControlHub_1_0_0_0.zip --folder solution\src --packagetype Unmanaged
```

---

## ⚙️ Enable Code Apps on Your Environment

1. Go to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
2. **Manage → Environments → \<your environment\>**.
3. **Settings → Product → Features**.
4. Toggle **Enable code apps** → **Save**.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Issues

- The Inventory API is automatically paginated via `skipToken` — all pages are fetched transparently, so tenants with thousands of resources are fully supported.
- The app requires the signed-in user to be a **Power Platform tenant admin** to read cross-environment data.
- The **Microsoft Dataverse connector** is used to query Copilot Studio bot records. The bundled solution (`solution/`) imports the required `ppa_resourcetombstone` table.
- **DLP policy connector groups do not auto-populate** — when creating or updating a policy, all connector assignments must be explicitly provided. The create page handles this by loading connectors from a selected environment. See [known issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/powerplatformforadmins/#known-issues-and-limitations).
- Code apps are **not** supported in the Power Apps mobile app or Power Apps for Windows.
- Code apps **do not** support Power Platform Git integration.
- The `src/generated/` folder is gitignored — every collaborator must run `npx power-apps add-data-source` for all five connectors after cloning.
